# SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!

## Overview
## Step 1 - Climate App
### Get the Data
1. Import Dependencies
2. Reflect Tables into SQL Alchemy ORM
3. Data exploration.

### Precipitation Analysis
1.  Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
2.  Data display of  `date` and `prcp` values in Panda.
3.  Plot the results.
4.  Summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Precipitation Analysis
1. Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.
2. Design a query to find the most active stations.
  * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.
  * Identify station with highest number of observations.
3. Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).
  * Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.
  * Plot the results as a histogram.

## Step 2 - Climate App
1. Use FLASK to develop climate APP (API)
2. Create landing page
3. Create query that returns data in JSON format
    A. Precipitation for last year.
    B. List of Stations. 
    C. Temprature data.
    D. Search temprature data by date.
    E. Search temprature data by date range.
